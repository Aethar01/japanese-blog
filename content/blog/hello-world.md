This is the first post on my new blog. As you can probably tell from the name of the site, the main topic will be Japanese. However, I'll probably just write about things that I find interesting.

## Site Details

- **Statically Generated**: Using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and self-hosted with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- **Simple Theme**: Made by myself. (You can switch between light and dark mode in the corner over there ↘)

## Example Content

Here is an example of an image:

And some code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

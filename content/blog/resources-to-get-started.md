One of the toughest things when learning a new language is knowing where to start, and even if you do, how are you supposed to know if the resources you've found are any good?

I'm not a native speaker so I've experienced this exact problem. So, with 6 years of studying Japanese I thought I'd share some resources that I found invaluable.

For each entry, I'll include a link, a short description and why I think it's a good resource.

## From Zero

- [**Tofugu's Learn Japanese**](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese) - Tofugu is a website that offers a lot of resources for learning Japanese, you'll see them pop up a couple times in this blog and they are really excellent for beginners. This article provides an great step-by-step guide to begin your studies.

## Basic Reading

Before anything else, you'll need to known how to read. Some people say that you can skip this part and just learn how to speak but I vehemently disagree. The Japanese language and its writing systems are deeply intertwined, you'll be severely limiting yourself in the long run if you do not learn how to read.

- [**Learn Hiragana: The Ultimate Guide**](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana) - This resource teaches hiragana with some cute illustrations and embedded audio bites. When starting off, characters can look incredibly similar, so cute illustrations can really help learning these for the first time.
- [**Learn Katakana: The Ultimate Guide**](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana) - Same as the previous one but for katakana. You'll feel like it's pointless learning the same sounds again, but if you cant read both katakana and hiragana you'll really struggle with **Kanji**.
- [**Real Kana**](https://realkana.com) - Practice the **Hiragana** and **Katakana** you've just learned. Grind these till you do not make any mistakes.
- [**Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese - Kanji**](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/kanji) - What is **Kanji**? Tae Kim's Guide to learning Japanese will be another resource mentioned a few times (you might notice this sites favicon is inspired by theirs). This short article explains what **Kanji** is and why **Kanji** is used. Don't worry, you're not expected to learn all the **Kanji** straight away [that would be impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji), but you should get to grips with what it is and start as soon as possible! I promise it will make learning Japanese a lot faster.

Now that you can finally read, it's time to learn some grammar!

## Basic Grammar

- [**Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese - Basic Grammar**](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/category/grammar-guide/basic-grammar) - Widely regarded as one of the best resources especially for grammar. No more to say, it's just an excellent resource. Read through the articles at a pace that suites you while you get started with the next section *Learning Vocabulary*.
- [**Wikipedia's Japanese Grammar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_grammar) - A comprehensive overview of all the grammar. Don't use this to learn the grammar, but it's great to reference when you need to quickly look something up.

## Learning Vocabulary

This is the meat of the whole process. [**Zipf's Law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) tells us that frequency of in use words is inversely proportional to their rank in order of usage. Basically, this means you'll only need to learn about 5000 words to understand 80% of daily conversations in Japanese! Ah... That's still quite a lot. Oh well better start now then.

- [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net) - This flashcard app is the Japanese language learning community's go-to for a reason. It's free, uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and supports images and audio.
- [**Anki Decks**](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=japanese&sort=rating) - Luckily for us, many people have already created excellent decks for Anki! While you are free to use any deck you want, I'll list a few below that I have found to be excellent. I also recommend not learning from decks that are just words without a sentence. This is because many words in Japanese (like any language) are context specific, this is especially the case with adjective like words that require another to make sense.
    - [**Japanese Core 2000 2k - Sorted w/ Audio**](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2141233552) - This deck has the first 2000 most commonly used words in Japanese! Its very useful to start off with since you'll quickly begin to recognize these words all over the place.
    - [**Japanese course based on Tae Kim's grammar guide & anime**](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/911122782) - This deck uses Tae Kim's grammar guide (the one mentioned above) and includes examples from anime with their audio.
    - [**Nayr's Core 5k Revised**](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/813424842) - Like the 2k deck, this deck has the first 5000 most commonly used words in Japanese. I highly recommend starting this deck after finishing the 2k deck since its a natural extension.

### Recommended Anki settings

There's a lot of fuss about which settings and such are optimal for Anki, I personally don't think it matters that much as long as you are honest with yourself and try to answer the **Again**, **Good**, **Easy** and **Hard** questions properly, but I would recommend clicking the little cog on the decks you use, going to options, setting a number of new cards per day that you can handle (10 is probably reasonable) and turning on FSRS (a slightly better algorithm than the default).

## Reading Practice

Once you've got a good basis, you can start actually reading! I'm not going to go into too much detail, but the key here is to read what makes you want to read more. Personally I found **Shounen** manga to be particularly good for starting out; it often includes **furigana**, little **hirigana** and **katakana** next to the **kanji** allowing you to easily look up meanings of **kanji** you haven't seen before and allows you too keep up the pace when reading.

If you are reading anything on the internet, you'll probably want to use hover dictionary. This is a browser extension that allows you to hold down a key, hover over a word and find its meaning in a little pop-up.
- [**Rikaitan**](https://rikaitan.github.io) - This is the hover dictionary extension I use. From within the extension's settings, you can download the recommended dictionaries, JMdict, JMnedict and KANJIDIC. (I'd also recommend a pitch accent dictionary like [this one](https://mega.nz/file/A5cRxIpY#fcCGZyWX6cZoFYwKoKzbdHnxm_S86WM3PSbDA4ifKUM) (link valid as of 2026/02/05)).
